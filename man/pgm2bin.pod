=head1 NAME

pgm2bin - convert PGM image files to text-encoded binary format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

pgm2bin [-hblank n] [-vblank n] bitwidth in_file out_file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program can be used to convert PGM files to text-encoded binary format to be used
by the testbenches generated by the VHDL backend of the CAPH compiler

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over

=item bitwidth

size, in bits, of the data words to write in the output file (including the two extra bits for tagging)

=item in_file

name of the input file 

=item out_file

name of the output file 

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -hblank n

insert I<n> "no data" extra tokens (C<00xxxxxx>) in the output file after each C<EoS> token (end of line)

=item -vblank n

insert I<n> "no data" extra tokens (C<00xxxxxx>) in the output file after each pair of successive C<EoS> token (end of frame)

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

The program returns a zero exist status if it succeeds and a non zero value in case of failure. In
the latter case, an error message is printed to stderr.

=head1 CAVEAT

The size in bits of individual words in the output file is I<n+2>, where I<n> is the specified bitwidth. The two extra bits are used to encode the tag.

Using the special value C<00xxxxx> to handle blanking is a hack. It can also significantly increase the size of the output file.
