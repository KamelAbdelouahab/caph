\chapter{Compilation options}
\label{cha:ide-options}

The caph compiler comes with a fairly large number of options (see Sec. 12 of the language reference
manual). Most of these options can be set and inspected by invoking \textsf{Compilater options} item
of the \textsf{Configuration} menu. Options are organized by grouped by tabs, as illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:options-sysc}, in which the tab related to SystemC has been selected.

  \label{fig:options-sysc}
\end{figure}

\medskip An important point is that, when working in project mode, each modification to compilation
options is recorded and saved in a dedicated file in the project directory. This file, when present,
is automatically read when a project is opened. This way, compilation options are remembered between
sessions.
