This directory contains the Qt-based GUI to the Caph compiler.
A brief introduction can be found in ../doc/primer/caph-primer.pdf
This code is a recrafting of an initial version written by P. Arnold and D. Charette during an intership in 2013.

What can be done with the Caph GUI

- writing/reading .cph source files (with syntax coloring)
- writing/reading .txt sim i/o files 
- grouping these files into "projects"
- generating .dot files and viewing them (by running dotty)
- running simulations (reading .txt inp files and writing .txt outp files)
- generating SystemC code (and Makefile)
- generating VHDL code (and Makefile)

What can _not_ be done
- compiling and running generated SystemC code (this is too much dependent on the actual platform)
- compiling and running generated VHDL code (this is too much dependent on the actual platform)
- in the two latter case, the idea is that the application is just a front-end used to generate code in a target directory
  and that these files are latter exploited by a separate tool or set of tools
