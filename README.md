CAPH 
====

**CAPH** is a domain-specific language for describing and implementing stream-processing applications on
reconfigurable hardware, such as FPGAs. **CAPH** generates VHDL code from high-level descriptions of
signal or image processing applications. **CAPH** relies upon the actor/dataflow model of
computation. Applications are described as networks of purely dataflow actors exchanging tokens
through unidirectional channels and the behavior of each actor is defined as a set of transition
rules using pattern matching.

**CAPH** comes with :

* a _higher-order, purely functional language_ for description of complex dataflow networks
* a _rich type system_ with sized-integers, booleans, floats, fully polymorphic _algebraic data
  types_ and _dependent types_
* automatic _type inference_ and type-checking
* _higher-order actors_ (actors taking functions as parameters)
* _pattern-matching_ based description of actor behavior
* _graphical visualisation_ of dataflow networks
* _code simulation_ with trace facilities
* **SystemC** back-end for simulation
* **VHDL** backend, generating  _target-independant_, _ready-to-synthetize_, time and space-efficient VHDL code
* a _foreign-function interface_ (FFI) to use existing SystemC or VHDL code
