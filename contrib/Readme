This directory contains extra contributions to the Caph system.

You will typically find here platform-specific code and libraries (for dedicated hardware platforms
for instance), external tools (for reading/writing data files or displaying results, ...)
or small applications written in Caph

These contributions are not "officially" supported (i.e. they are not part of the 
packaged releases available on the web site) but can be obtained from the Github repository.

Every Caph user is strongly encouraged to contribute !
